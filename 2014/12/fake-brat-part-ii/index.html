  <p>The day flew by without trouble. I hadn’t seen the new guy since biology class, and apart from catching him staring at me a few times, we still hadn’t properly conversed. Katelyn and I were walking out of the school and towards my ride when a young girl bumped into me. The girl, who couldn’t have been older than fifteen, fell to floor along with her multiple papers that were now scattered. I started to bend down to help her, but before I could even touch one piece of paper she looked up at me with fear written all over her face.</p>

<p>“I-I’m so sorry Jennifer Moorse, I didn’t m-mean to disturb you, or to talk to you, or even touch you.” She quickly picked up all the pieces of papers and pulled herself up. “It will never happen again p-promised. I’m so s-sorry!” She turned around and ran away. I sighed as I watched her jolt away. This kind of behavior wouldn’t disturb me if a freshman would act like this around every senior, but I knew that they only acted like this with me.</p>

<p>Katelyn didn’t comment but silently followed me as I started walking again towards my ride. I noticed that most of the students were cautiously watching my every move, expecting me to have some kind of drama queen explosion about having a “nobody” interact with me. The truth is, even if I did help out that girl the way I wanted to, they would have analyzed that kind action as a rich girl just wanting to get some attention from others. Whatever I did, they would always find a way to paint me as a spoiled rich kid. And there wasn’t much I could do to fight that sort of prejudice, and so I continued walking a black Bentley: my ride. Of course along with such an expensive car came a driver. I mean, Why learn how to drive when you can buy a driver or at least that’s what my mom says. Katelyn and I slided into the car and Mark, my driver, started the engine.</p>

<p>“Hi Mark,” Katelyn and me said unison.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon Ms. Moorse, Ms. Janson.” Mark replied. “Where to?”</p>

<p>“Home, please.” Mark nodded and pulled the car out the parking lot of the school. “And Mark?”</p>

<p>“Yes Miss.”</p>

<p>“Don’t call us from our surnames, we are all friends in here.” I told him for the hundredth time.</p>

<p>Mark laughed, “Ok Jennifer.”</p>

<p>“So-o…” Katelyn said breaking the comfortable silent. “Want to talk about what just happened five minutes ago?”</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes. “There isn’t much to talk about. It’s the same thing every time. They are scared of me, or at least of what I can do.”</p>

<p>Katelyn nodded in agreement. “I was just shocked she actually remembered your name instead of only your surname.” We laughed about it for a few seconds until we fell back into a comfortable silence accompanied by radio’s music in the background.</p>

<p>A few minutes later we arrived to my bombastic and exaggeratedly large house. I thanked Mark for taking us home and walked through the two huge white doors that were opened by our butler, Jason.  I was about to thank him when my, ever so lovely, mother popped out of nowhere and interrupt me.</p>

<p>“Oh sweetheart! Thank God you’re home. I called your hairdresser and she’s waiting for you in your room.</p>

<p>“Meredith? Why is she here?” I asked her curiously.</p>

<p>“Well to do your hair for tonight’s party silly. I know it’s a last minute thing but the Clarkson’s are throwing an extremely important party at the Royal Hotel.”</p>

<p>I groaned. “Another party? Can’t I stay home for just one Friday night?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely not!” She replied as if I had asked the most offensive thing in the world. “You, along with this family, have an image to uphold!” She looked at Katelyn that was standing next to me silently. “ You can bring your friend, uh-h-h, Katherine right?”</p>

<p>“Katelyn mum! She’s been my best friend since we were five!” I said angrily.</p>

<p>“Sure… Why you’re at it, why don’t you call that handsome friend Jackson?” She answered not really caring about Katelyn, but about my pretentious ex-boyfriend, who she wanted me to marry.</p>

<p>“Because we broke up about a week ago, and also because he’s a dou-“</p>

<p>“Cassandra?” My dad walked in calling for my mom, interrupting me. “Did you see my phone? I wanted to call the secretary.” As he stood in front of us he noticed me only later. “Oh Honey, sorry hadn’t seen you there.” He leaned to give me a kiss on the cheek but I moved out of his reach.</p>

<p>“You’re secretary?” I asked him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Yeah, her name is Ashley, she used to be a student at your school last year.” He told me, acting as if we both didn’t know who she really was; his mistress.</p>

<p>“You’re taking her to the party?” I asked shocked. Why was he bringing her to such an important event with all his and my mother’s friends? Wasn’t he afraid of being caught?</p>

<p>“Yes I need her for some work business.” He said nonchalant.</p>

<p>“For work or for you?” I challenged him. He gave me a stern look.</p>

<p>As tension grew in the air, I walked away from my parents with Katelyn by my side, silently as always.</p>
