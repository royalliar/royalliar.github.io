  <p>The limousine stopped in front of the luxurious hotel. As the chauffeur opened the door for us, we were blinded by the flash of the multiple cameras. My dad, wanting to prove his masculinity, was the first to step out of the car. He helped out my mother, who clutched on his side as she slid out the car elegantly. Together, with fake smiles plastered on their faces, they walked down the carpet and towards the double door entrance. Sometimes stopping to pose for the paparazzi, so that their loving couple image would be pictured and later on advertised to the world. If only they knew how truly loving they were towards each other.</p>

<p>Katelyn and I were next. Our hair was brushed and burned to perfection while our faces were painted on like canvasses. Unlike my parents, we never stopped to pose. We walked, well more like cantered, down the carpet, with our head held high as we ignored the shouts from the reporters and paparazzi calling for us to give them a chance for a good photo and even a word or two. I could see the different people being stopped to pose and interviewed, as I continued my long walk towards the entrance. Some looked happy while others looked smug. But one group stood out more than others: two teenage girls, just a few years younger than us. They were being interviewed by a famous reporter, which I had forgotten the name. Didn’t really matter, each one of them were the same at the end. Telling you to be yourself but really wanting you to be the person that sells. The teenage girls look scared and excited at the same time. They must be newbies. You could tell by how one of them, who looked flustered and nervous, was playing with her hair. A big no-no in this world. It made her posture crooked and her personality look weak. Or at least that is what the other people walking down this carpet would say. I, on the other hand, think it’s cute. It made her look almost innocent. An adjective never used among people with fame or power. It wasn’t like they weren’t nice people, some were actually decent. It’s just that none of us could actually permit to be seen as innocent. The media would eat you alive, while your rivals would squash you without mercy.</p>

<p>Katelyn and I finally reached the doors that shielded us away from the blinding light. Once in, they took us in this large opulent room, with large chandeliers and expensive paintings. Everything seemed so forced. As if the hosts had to show off their wealth by putting the most luxuries things they owned in the room. We walked off to our assigned table and sat down in sighed unison.</p>

<p>“Well, this is going to be fun.” Katelyn said, sarcasm pouring from every word. I laughed in agreement.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it, we’ll stay here just for about an hour, then sneak out, grab a taxi and head at Joe’s. Sounds cool?” I asked her, observing my father who was talking business with his friends while his hand lay on the very low back of his “secretary”, Ashley.</p>

<p>“Sounds like our typical Friday night.” She replied as she gave me a humorous smile.</p>

<p>I nodded in agreement, a similar smile sneaking up on my lips. “I’m going to get something to drink, want anything?” Katelyn shook her head as she continued to observe the people around the room.</p>

<p>I walked around, pushing through crowds of people as I searched for even a sneak peek of the bar. I tried to avoid my parents or any of their acquaintances not being in the mood to have any formal chit-chat about business or how I should date one of their sons. However, I had no such luck as my mum’s eyes met mine. She called for my name, but, acting as if I hadn’t seen or heard her, I span around and walked away only to crash into someone. All the sudden everything was blurry and I could hear the wind rushing by my ear, until I stopped moving and heard a low grunt come from underneath me. I had realized too late that I had fell on top of someone. And not just anyone, but on the owner of those familiar beautiful green eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m so s-sorry.” I stuttered as I continued to stare into his captivating eyes. I still couldn’t believe I just fell on top of the new kid from my school.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s fine. I’m use to having girls fall for me.” He replied nonchalant, a smirk forming on his lips.</p>

<p>I laughed. “Excuse me? I didn’t fall for you, it was a mere accident! I’m not even attracted to you.” I snapped back.</p>

<p>“Really?” He asked. “Then why are you still laying on me?” His smirk grew.</p>

<p>My mouth was snap shut as I noticed that what he had said was true. I could feel the blood being drawn to my face, as a strong blush formed. I quickly pulled away, petting my dress down. I turned away from him, only to notice that we had gathered a crowd that included both Katelyn and my parents.</p>

<p>I was never going to hear the end of this from neither of them.</p>
