  <p>There is no questioning the fact that women in society are undermined. All throughout history, women haven’t enjoyed the same freedoms as men. For example, until recently, women weren’t allowed to work, did not receive equal pay, and were not granted voting rights. While in many MEDC this is no longer a problem, women in many countries are still denied these basic human rights. International Women’s Day however, celebrates all that women have accomplished economically, politically and socially. Proposed by Clara Zetkin, leader of the Women’s Office for the Social Democratic Party in Germany, in 1910, and passed at the International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen, Women’s Day was first held on March 19th. More than 30,000 women attended street demonstrations across Europe that day. In 1917, working women in Saint Petersburg took to the streets on the last Sunday of February (March 8th in the Gregorian calendar) to strike for “Bread and Peace”, demanding an end to czarism, WWI, and food shortage in Russia. March 8th was deemed an official holiday in the USSR by Lenin and the Bolshevik party after the October (November according to the Gregorian calendar) Revolution. Other communist nations, such as China and Spain, followed in making this an official holiday. In 1977 the United Nations General Assembly made March 8th an internationally recognized day for world peace and women’s rights.</p>
