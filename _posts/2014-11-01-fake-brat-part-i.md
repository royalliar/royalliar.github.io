Money, one of the only things I extremely hated yet needed it to survive. It built up my life but, at the same time, ruined it. It allowed me to go to any school I wanted, choose whatever job I wanted, travel where ever I wanted and get anything I wanted. But it also made me insecure, and doubt my friends’ true intentions; making me often lonely.

In today’s society money was not anymore just a form of survival, but it also determined where you stood in society, or as I like to call it, “humanity’s food chain”. If you were wealthy you automatically had power over others less fortunate than you. I never truly understood the reason, but it seemed to be the primary rule of life. And I, being the daughter of Jacobe Moorse; a well known, wealthy businessman, know all about it.

People automatically presumed I was a spoiled, fake and heartless brat. And I gave them no reason to believe other wise.  I couldn’t be bothered to prove them wrong, and acted exactly like society and the press wanted me to act. I think there is only one person in my life that actually knows who the real me is, and that is my best friend Katelyn. Not even my parents knew what was really going on in my life. My father was too busy cheating on my mother with a former student at my school; she graduated last year from high school. I had caught them “cuddling” two years ago, while I was still a sophomore and she was one of my best friends, in my room. My father, after I screamed and ran out of the room from the horror, came after me and convinced me to not tell my mother anything. In all honesty there wasn’t much convincing needed, as I wouldn’t want to be the one giving her the heartbreaking news. Plus she was too deep into society to care about anything else but which dress to wear at which party. So yeah, my parents were too busy with their own lives to even notice that their own daughter disappeared for a whole two weeks last year. But Katelyn. Oh Katelyn. There hasn’t past been a moment in my life where Katelyn wasn’t there for me. I mean, it would be an insult towards her to even call her a friend instead of a sister.

“Earth to Jenna!” Katelyn’s hand waved in front of my face.

“Huh?!” I whipped my face to hers and blinked. “What did I miss?”

“The new student’s introduction. He’s quite a looker, but he also has that kind of bad-boy vibe, which means all the girls are going to be drooling over him.” She babbled on while sketching in her notebook.  

New student? What was she talking about? I looked around the dull grey laboratory only to see a blond male around my age standing next to the teacher’s desk. The boy’s green eyes met mine and we just stared at each other for a few seconds. His lips formed a perfect smirked right before he ripped his eyes off me and turned his attention back to the old teacher. I knew, right there and then that, just like in any cliché teenage story, this boy wasn’t going to be anything but trouble.
