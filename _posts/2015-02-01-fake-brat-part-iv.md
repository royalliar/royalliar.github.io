Katelyn and I trotted up to apartment 6B where the sound of muffled voices and loud music was coming from. A few seconds before Katelyn was about to ring the doorbell, my phone started to ring.

“Ugh, just a second. It’s my parents, if I don’t answer now they won’t stop calling me all night long.” I told Katelyn as I answered the phone.

Before I could even put the phone up to my ear, the screeching sound of my mothers voice flew through the speakers.

“Where the heck are you?”

“I’m fine thanks for asking,” I sighed, “I’m at a friend’s house.”

“Do you think after what you did at the gala I will allow you to just wonder off like that?”

“Nothing happened mother! I just fell on a guy, that’s it.”

“Nothing happened?!” She asked me, her voice slowly rising in volume to match her obvious anger. “You embarrassed both me and your father and just left the party! That’s what happened.”

All of the sudden there was a low voice talking to my mother in the background.

“Is that her?” My father asked. My mother must have nodded her head and given him the phone because next thing I knew, my father was shouting at me just like my mother had done.

“You are in so much trouble young lady!”

“Oh I’m sorry, is your secretary too busy that you actually noticed something going on in your family.” I asked him my anger growing just as much as theirs. “You know what, do whatever you want, I’ll see you later.” I hanged up before either of them could say anything else. I turned back around to face Katelyn and gave her a small nod. She replied with a warm smile before ringing the doorbell.

“Hey Joe!” Katelyn shouted as Joe opened the door to his apartment. He didn’t change at all since the last time we saw him. He was still the same thin, tall guy with dark hair and a matching beard. I mean, if  you can even call two hairs on his chin a beard. We told him it looked ridiculous but he wouldn’t listen claiming that it made him more of a “man.”

“Hey ladies,” Joe replied once he saw it was us. “Dressed a bit formal for my party?” He asked examining our long gowns.

“You are throwing a party and didn’t think of inviting us? Consider me offended!” Katelyn replied ignoring his question.

Joe shrugged, “I knew you two would be coming whether I was inviting you or not so there wasn’t really any need to.” He opened the door wider allowing us to walk passed him and into the apartment. Joe, being a sophomore at university, had a small apartment all to himself meaning that every now and then he would allow himself the pleasure of throwing a party. The apartment wasn’t luxurious and opulent like the things I was used to, but that is why I loved coming here so much. Unlike the other parties Joe threw, there wasn’t such a large crowd of people.

“You wouldn’t believe what Jennifer did at her parent’s friend’s gala just about an hour ago.” Katelyn said not waiting a minute longer to share my embarrassing moment with our friend. After I fell on the new kid in front of everyone Katelyn pulled me away from the crowd. Together we sneaked out the back entrance of the hotel and caught a taxi so that we could come here. We both knew better than to stick around the gala after the stunt I had just pulled off.

“Let me guess, she fell on some handsome blonde hair, green eyed guy in front of everyone.” Joe replied while dropping down to sit on his old sofa.

“Yeah… How did you know?”

“Its already all over those stupid gossip sites.” He replied pulling out his phone. “Jennifer Moorse throws herself on her new mysterious guy at the Clarkson’s gala at the Royal Hotel.” Joe read off one of the sites.

“What?!” I snatched the phone out of his hands. I scroll down the page only to see that he was telling the truth. They were actually claiming that I “purposely threw” myself on him! It couldn’t get any more embarrassing than that.

“Who cares about what these stupid sites say.” Joe reassured me once he saw my flushed face. He took his phone back and pocketed it in his jeans. “Just relax and have some fun.” I replied with a nod and allowed Katelyn to drag me off to the kitchen so we could get something to drink.

The hours passed and so did the memory of the gala. We danced and laughed along the beat of the music. The room was hot and sticky, filled with the warmth of too many human bodies in a closed place. My mind was fuzzy, my sight was blurry and my skin was numb. I had lost Katelyn a few minutes after we had started dancing and was now talking to a girl about a book we had both read. Slowly losing interest in the subject I looked around the foggy room. There was one guy sitting on the old sofa watching television, but he seemed indecisive of what he wanted to watch as he continued to flip through the channels.  A group of his friends called his name distracting him from the television that was now left on the News. All of the sudden I felt my feet move away from the girl in the middle of her discussion and towards the television as a picture of my parents appeared near the reporter.

“Turn it up…” I told the guy sitting on the old sofa.

“What?” The guy asked me not really paying attention to what I had said.

“I said turn it up!” I shouted at the guy, getting annoyed that he was being so slow. Startled by my sudden aggression he turned the volume up. The whole room seemed to be silenced, the only thing I could hear was the reporter’s annoyingly perfect voice, “ Jacobe Moorse and Cassandra Moorse instantly dead in a car accident seconds after their exit from the Royal Hotel…”
